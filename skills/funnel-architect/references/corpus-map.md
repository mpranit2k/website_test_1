# Corpus map — where the live transcripts are + how to mine

The funnel-architect council is grounded in a local transcript corpus (~47k transcripts, ~185 creators on sales/marketing/client-acquisition/persuasion). This file tells the mining agents where to look. If these paths don't exist (different machine), fall back to the distilled `creator-council.md` and flag that quotes are distilled, not freshly mined.

## Roots (on Vik's machine)

| Path | What's there | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `/Users/vik/Second Brain/02 - Creators/<Name>.md` | per-creator index (video list, counts) | wikilink index |
| `/Users/vik/Second Brain/03 - Transcripts/<Category>/<Creator>/*.md` | the main transcript set, by topic then creator | markdown |
| `/Users/vik/Second Brain/scrape_output/<Creator>/transcripts/*.txt` | raw deep scrapes (Alex_Hormozi, Leila_Hormozi, Charlie_Morgan_Business, Charlie_Morgan_Main, Codie_Sanchez, Naval, Sahil_Bloom) | raw .txt |
| `/Users/vik/Second Brain/scrape_output_v2/<Category>/<Creator>/` | second scrape, by category → creator | mixed |
| `/Users/vik/Second Brain/06 - Research/_Coverage Report.md` | which creators are transcribed vs ZERO_TX | report |

## Mining protocol (per agent, read-only)

1. **Locate** the creator's folder (try the table; if absent, `ls`/`find`/grep the roots). If a folder is empty / ZERO_TX, report unavailable and STOP for that creator (cite-or-cut — never invent).
2. **Grep** the transcripts for the dimension's key terms; read excerpts around the strongest 6–15 hits. Don't read everything.
3. **Extract** the creator's teaching as specific principles, each with a **VERBATIM substring quote + source filename**. Verify the quote is a real substring before keeping it (transcripts carry per-line timestamp prefixes — normalize for those).
4. **Apply** to THIS funnel: what to do, the spec, the number it's judged on. Return structured findings.

## Saving / porting the corpus

- The **distilled IP** (the reusable essence) lives in `creator-council.md` — that travels with the skill and works anywhere.
- The **live transcripts** stay in the vault (too large to bundle — ~47k files). This map points to them for fresh mining on Vik's machine.
- To make the skill fully portable with raw quotes on another machine, snapshot just the council creators' folders (the ~20 above), not the whole corpus. Ask before doing this — it's hundreds of MB.
